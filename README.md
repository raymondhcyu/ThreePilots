# ThreePilots
Math probability exercise

'''
Recently, a Pakistani International Airlines flight crash landed; a subsequent investgiation
showed that around one in three pilots there had fabricated credentials. This script simulates 
the probabilities of having a pilot with fabricated credentials in a typical two-person cockpit
of a commercial flight.

TL;DR: Validation of a casual brainstorming discussion using execessive computational power

The expected result is 1/9 chance both pilots having fabricated credentials, 4/9 chance a single
pilot having fabricated credentials, and 4/9 of both pilots having real credentials.
